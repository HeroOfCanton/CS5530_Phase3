# CS5530_Phase3
JSP / Tomcat application

This is strictly a brute force conversion of the console application built in Phase 2 for CS5530
While this is a standalone web application, there has been no effort made towards correct coding practices,
style, or towards the UI/UX. There is no sanitization of inputs, nor are there any data validations done, 
either on input or output.

This is not meant to be an example of correct JSP, Jave, or general Web Developement. 

This may not be used in any form, either in part or as a whole, either for commercial, personal, educational, 
training, example, or any other usage.
